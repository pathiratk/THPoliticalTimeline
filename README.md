# THPoliticalTimeline

This project is started as my creative project for CSE 154 Web Programming Class at the University of Washington in Spring, 2017.

When I was in school, It was difficult for me to see the big picture of the political events in Thailand. So I am developing this timeline in the hope that it would help me or anyone have the broader view of Thai politics.  

## TODO:
- [ ] Add more events
- [ ] Add more detail to the event including photos and dates
- [ ] Add a linear time scale
